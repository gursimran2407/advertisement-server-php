Future Scope

In the future, certain amendments and enhancement can be made in the existing system. Also
any enhancement can be done with simplicity and without complexity.
Future enhancements can also be made based on the new technologies. The enhancements
can be as adding more functionality to the application, adding more simplicity in formatting
of data files, or even adding more robustness to the code.

¥ Payment system could be added through which clients and advertisers can receive and
give payments through online banking.
¥ Admin acts as a mediator in this system, and he/she gets the commission when the
publisher hosts their ads in the website.
¥ Campaign system can be added in future in which the ads can be grouped according to
similarity into groups.
¥ In future Ad Server can employ advanced forecasting tools that include multi-variant,
ad unit level analysis, real-time inventory data, and incorporation of multiple targeting
and seasonality variables.
¥ Our solution lets publishers take advantage of internal and external efficiencies and
make the best use of both human and financial capital.
¥ In future an open API (Application Programming Interface) can allow direct and easy
integration with existing internal systems and third-party platforms.
¥ Our solution also lets publishers fine-tune relevance of ads to consumers by supporting
“and/or” decisions and targeting across content, audience, geography, technology, and
custom variables. This results in publishers being able to offer a superior advertising
experience to sophisticated, premium advertisers who want to reach consumers with ads
that are effective and engaging.
¥ Behavioural Targeting can be used in future which is a technique used by online
publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns through
information collected on an individual’s Web-browsing behavior, such as the pages
they have visited or the searches they have made, to select which advertisements to
display to that individual. The technique helps deliver online advertisements to the users
who will be the most interested in them. Behavioral data can also be combined with
other user information such as purchase history to create a more complete user profile.
How Does Behavioral Targeting Work?
When a user visits a website a cookie is placed onto the computer. The cookie has
details about your visit that help separate you into a specific group. From that point,
websites that use behavioral targeting will only show you information that is relevant to
you.
Benefits of Behavioral Targeting
Proponents of behavioral targeting believe that it is beneficial for the user and the
online property. A more targeted experience will naturally be more interesting to a user
and provide an improved visitor experience.
Advertisers are also able to benefit because users will be more engaged in targeted
advertisements. This leads to improved click-through-rates and higher levels of
interaction.
¥ Hover ads are a special type of pop-up ads created using Dynamic HTML, JavaScript
and similar web browser technologies. Because they do not scroll with the web page,
they appear to "hover" over the page, usually obscuring the content.
¥ A live banner is a banner ad which is created dynamically (or whose content is created
dynamically) at the time of display, instead of being pre-programmed with fixed
content. Live banners function the same way as traditional web banners: promoting a
brand, product, service, or an event, except that the banner content is variable and may
even update in real time
